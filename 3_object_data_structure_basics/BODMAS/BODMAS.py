'''
BODMAS (or BIDMAS)
Evalutates which order you should do mathamatical operations
B = Brackets
O = Order (or indices) - square roots, squares
D = Division
M = Multiplication
A = Addition
S = Subtraction

In this excercise we evalute a number of equations to show the differences
'''

# Evaluate 4 * (6 + 5)

a = "4 * (6 + 5)"
b = 4 * (6 + 5)
c = str(b)

print("The output of " + a + " is " + c)

# Evaluate 4 * 6 + 5 

d = "4 * 6 + 5"
e = 4 * 6 + 5
f = str(e)

print("The output of " + d + " is " + f)

# Evaluate 4 + 6 * 5 

g = "4 + 6 * 5"
h = 4 + 6 * 5 
i = str(h)

print("The output of " + g + " is " + i)
